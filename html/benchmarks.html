    <h1>Scalability Benchmark</h1>
    <p>N producer threads push a 4-byte integer into one queue, N consumer threads pop the integers from the queue. Each producer posts 1,000,000 messages. Total time to send and receive all the messages is measured. The benchmark is run for from 1 producer and 1 consumer up to (total-number-of-cpus / 2 - 1) producers/consumers to measure the scalabilty of different queues.</p>

    <p>Note: Intel Xeon Gold 6132 benchmarks use 1 NUMA node for up to 6 producers/consumers, 2 NUMA nodes are used for 7 producers/consumers or more. This is why throughput drops at 7 producers/consumers.</p>
    <h1>Latency Benchmark</h1>
    <p>One thread posts an integer to another thread and waits for the reply using two queues. The benchmarks measures the total time of 100,000 ping-pongs, best of 10 runs. Contention is minimal here to be able to achieve and measure the lowest latency. Reports the average round-trip time.</p>
